# MITCOS #

### version 0.02.0 ###

## by Mvf314 ##

## Summary ##

MITCOS is a hobby operating system created in my free time. This project is not aiming to make the world a better place by creating a revoluionary new OS, but more as a learning experience for me.

## Naming ##

MITCOS stands for "MITCOS Is The Coolest Operating System", but if you want a non-recursive version, there is another meaning: "Mvf314's Interesting but Terrible and Crappy Operating System".
