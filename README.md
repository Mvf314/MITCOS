## Introduction ##

MITCOS is a hobby project where I will try to make an operating system.

Note: I use the OSdev wiki (wiki.osdev.org) religiously, so don't be surprised if the code is mostly the same as the examples given on that site. Of course, when I have a basic kernel up I will try to implement as much as my own knowledge in the OS. A lot of the comments are also the same, but they are so I can take a look at the code and know exactly what is does and why it does that. Most of the comments will contain the same information, maybe worded a little bit differently.

## Naming ##

MITCOS stands for "MITCOS Is The Coolest Operating System", but it can also stand for "Mvf314's Interesting but Terrible and Crappy Operating System".
